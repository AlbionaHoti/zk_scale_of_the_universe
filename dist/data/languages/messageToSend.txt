Here's a new file with the 21 language files. I added seven lines at the end for each file, that have the following information:
1) "The ZK Scale of the Universe"
2) "Use the scroll bar to zoom in and out."
3) "Click on objects to learn more."
4) "Start"

I added the last two, in case it makes stuff easier!
